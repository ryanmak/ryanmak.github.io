                        After deciding that I wanted to work towards something related to programming and computers, I
                        wrote an application to several universities to study Computer Science. Wilfrid Laurier
                        University (WLU) was the
                        first university to respond, giving me an early offer and included a scholarship based on my
                        highschool grades. Ultimately, I decided that WLU would be my choice and I started my first
                        semester in Fall 2014. After 4 years of study and experiencing a home away from home, in Spring
                        2018 I stood with my fellow friends and graduates and accepted my <b>B.Sc Honours Computer
                            Science Degree</b>.
