            <h3>This Website - July/August 2021</h3>
            <p>I've been meaning to create a portfolio/resume website for a while but didn't know
                where to start. But upon learning that GitHub pages were a thing, I dedicated a weekend to get a basic
                webpage with
                HTML and CSS. I then used Bootstrap to handle some of the CSS legwork and started adding content to the
                website periodically. </p>

            <h3>TimeSheet Android App - March 2021 to Present (Stale)</h3>
            <p>A buddy of mine originally had this idea of keeping track of what he does every hour and wanted an easier
                way to record his data without access to a computer. He then set out to make an android app but didn't
                make much progress. I heard of his idea and tried to have a go at it myself involving my friend in the
                process. Using Java and MVVM, we pushed updates to a private repo in Github. Unfortunately, the project
                was later forgotten and continues to be forgotton. Maybe one day...
