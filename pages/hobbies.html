            <h3>DIY Desktop Computer Build</h3>
            <p> I've built many computers in the past so I'm well aquainted with the process of purchasing, assembling
                and upgrading a DIY desktop. But this build is special, its the first computer desktop I built with my
                own money, and is still in use today. I play predominantly multiplayer games (Battlefield, Overwatch,
                PUBG, Warthunder to name a few), but there are times where a good single player game really hits the
                mark too and has a special space in my heart (like Skyrim, Stardew Valley, FarCry, Cyberpunk 2077).</p>
            <p>My current PC specs are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU</li>
                <li>NVIDIA RTX 3080 ASUS TUF Gaming GPU (at MSRP if you can believe it)</li>
                <li>Crucial Ballistix DDR4 4x8GB 3600MHz RAM</li>
                <li>Crucial P1 1Tb M.2 SSD</li>
                <li>Gigabyte B550M DS3H Motherboard</li>
                <li>Phanteks AMP 750w Power Supply</li>

            <h3>iPod Modding (Ongoing)</h3>
            <p>Inspired by a really funny <a target="_blank"

                    channel</a>, I wanted to try and mod an iPod myself and make it look unique. After finding an iPod
                Video (5th generation) on the FaceBook Marketplace, I made a list of goals I wanted to acomplish when
                modding my iPod:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a Flash mod by replacing the Hard Drive (yes, these iPods had tiny spinning hard drives in them)
                    with an SD card.</li>
                <li>Replace the old battery with a 2500mah or greater capacity.</li>
                <li>Replace the front and back plates of the iPod with unique colours.</li>
                <li>Add a bluetooth module without sacrificing any core functionality (ie headphone jack).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3D Modelling and Printing </h3>
            <p>I was first introduced to 3D modelling in a highschool class called Tech Design. This class would
                eventually be given a couple of 3D printers for students to use, and I was immediately hooked. Since
                then, it was always in the back of my mind that 3D printers were only getting cheaper and that I would
                get one when the time was right. In my final year of university, I bought an Anet A8 3D printer from
                AliExpress and loved it. After a few months of use, I then upgraded to an Ender 3 and still use this
                printer to this day. </p>
            <p>Autodesk Inventor was still my tool of choice, and by using my student email I got the education version
                to play around with. Finding a website called <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>, I
                started uploading my designs and also downloaded other designs shared on the platform. All my designs
                can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/bravoman/designs">my Thingiverse
                    profile</a>, but
                below are my 3 most favourite designs I made.
